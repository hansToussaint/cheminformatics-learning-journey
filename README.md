# 🧪 Cheminformatics Learning Journey

From chemist to computational chemist.

⚠️ **Note:** This is a learning repository documenting my journey. Code quality improves progressively. Early projects are kept to show evolution.

## About Me

Chemist with a Bachelor's degree from Mendeleev University (Moscow). Currently transitioning to computational chemistry and cheminformatics.

**What makes me different:** I combine deep chemistry knowledge with software development skills (Python, React, JavaScript) to build complete solutions—from molecular modeling and ML predictions to interactive web dashboards for scientific teams.

**Goal:** Computational Chemist / Cheminformatics Scientist leveraging both domains  
**Location:** Montreal, QC, Canada
**Languages:** French (native), English (professional), Russian (fluent)

## Tech Stack

### Data Science & Cheminformatics
**Currently Learning:**
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- RDKit (molecular structures, descriptors, fingerprints)
- Machine Learning (Scikit-learn, XGBoost)
- Deep Learning (PyTorch, DeepChem, Graph Neural Networks)

### Software Development
**Previous Experience:**
- Frontend: React.js, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js, Express, Django, MongoDB, Firebase
- Tools: Git, GitHub, Figma, Testing (Jest, Cypress)

### Chemistry Expertise
- Organic synthesis & characterization
- Instrumental analysis (HPLC, GC, UV-Vis, IR, NMR)
- Quality control & assurance (current role)
- Chemical formulation (cosmetics, coatings)

### Combined Skill Application
Building scientific web applications that integrate:
- ML/cheminformatics models (backend)
- Interactive visualizations (frontend)
- Production deployment (full-stack)
